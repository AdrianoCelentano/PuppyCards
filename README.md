![Workflow result](https://github.com/AdrianoCelentano/PuppyCards/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
- Clicking on the like button opens the detail view with a poor shared element transition.
- Clicking on the image exits the detail view.
- Cards can be swiped away in any direction.
- If swiped only a little bit, they animate back in position.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
After showing a friend my implementation of tinder cards.
We came up with the idea of making it for dogs.
That's why i came up with this awkward compromise for this challenge.
Of course for puppies every swipe counts as a like!
Im quiet sure i failed the topic, just like back in school.
That's fine i had a lot of fun building it.
The animation Api is just awesome.
